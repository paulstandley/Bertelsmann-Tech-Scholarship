# Convolutional Neural Networks

## [Back](../README.md)

In this notebook, we train a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database.

The images in this database are small color images that fall into one of ten classes; some example images are pictured below.

### Test for CUDA

Since these are larger (32x32x3) images, it may prove useful to speed up your training time by using a GPU.

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and CUDA Tensors are the same as typical Tensors, only they utilize GPU's for computation.

```py

import torch
import numpy as np

# check if CUDA is available
train_on_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()

if not train_on_gpu:
    print('CUDA is not available.  Training on CPU ...')
else:
    print('CUDA is available!  Training on GPU ...')

```

### Load the DataÂ¶

Downloading may take a minute. 

We load in the training and test data, split the training data into a training and validation set, then create DataLoaders for each of these sets of data.

```py

from torchvision import datasets
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data.sampler import SubsetRandomSampler

# number of subprocesses to use for data loading
num_workers = 0
# how many samples per batch to load
batch_size = 20
# percentage of training set to use as validation
valid_size = 0.2

# convert data to a normalized torch.FloatTensor
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
    ])

# choose the training and test datasets
train_data = datasets.CIFAR10('data', train=True,
                              download=True, transform=transform)
test_data = datasets.CIFAR10('data', train=False,
                             download=True, transform=transform)

# obtain training indices that will be used for validation
num_train = len(train_data)
indices = list(range(num_train))
np.random.shuffle(indices)
split = int(np.floor(valid_size * num_train))
train_idx, valid_idx = indices[split:], indices[:split]

# define samplers for obtaining training and validation batches
train_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(train_idx)
valid_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(valid_idx)

# prepare data loaders (combine dataset and sampler)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size,
    sampler=train_sampler, num_workers=num_workers)
valid_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, 
    sampler=valid_sampler, num_workers=num_workers)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=batch_size, 
    num_workers=num_workers)

# specify the image classes
classes = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer',
           'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

```
