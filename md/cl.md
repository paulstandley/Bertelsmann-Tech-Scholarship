# Convolutional Layer

## [Back](../README.md)

In this notebook, we visualize four filtered outputs (a.k.a. activation maps) of a convolutional layer.

In this example, we are defining four filters that are applied to an input image by initializing the weights of a convolutional layer, but a trained CNN will learn the values of these weights.
